## 💡 Philosophy Section

### Section Title
**The Problem We're Solving**

### Content
Most people live their lives on autopilot. We have:
- **Scattered tools** - Notes in one app, tasks in another, goals somewhere else
- **No connection** - Your values don't connect to your daily actions
- **Reactive living** - Responding to what's urgent, not what matters
- **Lost context** - Can't remember why you made a decision 6 months ago

**The result?** You're busy but not intentional. Productive but not purposeful.

### Visual Element
*[Illustration: Scattered apps, disconnected dots, chaos]*
